    <p> Hello World! My name is Lorenz but my peer's know me as Lo. I am a Bay Area native and grew up in Vallejo, CA. I recieved my Bachelor's in Psychology and Business Administration at The University of Hawaii at Manoa. An island life experience wouldn't be filled if I didn't reigiously surf, dive, and hike... so that's exactly what I did! After completing my degree I immediately went to graduate school at Touro University California to continue my studies in Industrial/Organizational Psychology. My academic goal is to complete I/O Psychology at the Doctoral level. I chose Touro University because it allowed me to have a hybrid schedule of online and in person classes. Before starting my classes I had an amazing dream to travel the world while taking classes towards my masters degree. I thought it is was brilliant to pair adventure with academics. Unfortunately, with Covid-19, it was clear early on that I needed to rethink my plans. </p>

    <p>Naturally, once my travel plans were cancled indefinetly, I decided to apply for internships and jobs. Now residing back in the San Francisco Bay Area, the majority of the organizations I was appying too were seeking candidates with some sort of Data background. Understanding that my resume lacked this quality I decided the best way to spend the money I saved up for traveling was to use it towards another one. This one would be earning a Data Analytics certificate at U Berkeley. Data Analytics is an excellent pairing with I/O Psychology and a natural pivot. Although class material revolve around basic concepts, it's clear that these tools can serve a much larger picture. So, here it is, my first published HTML. Hope y'all like it (: </p>
